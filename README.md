# üêà AllPlants coding challenge!
## Duration: 4.5 hours

## How to run
- Simply copy the path from the html and paste into the browser. I would have built it in Angluar, but was working out of the downloaded file.

## What I would do next
- I would check through the objects if they had a tag of 'best'. If they did, I would then run a function where it maps over the array and add the images of the smiley face to the objects with the tag 'best'.
- I would also add a burger bar menu either as an svg or 3 divs made into lines to assume the classic burger menu icon. I would then create another innerHTML that would slide out from the left displaying the menu options.
